# Q-BLOWER MK1

##THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET FINISHED

Open-source version of the slime blower from Ghostbusters 2

In this repository, you can find all the STL files needed to 3D print your own 1:1 slime blower.
Our goal is to make the best, easy to use 3D printable version of the slime blower from Ghostbusters 2.
You can use the full project or parts of it for your build. It's very versatile. 
I took the time and effort to make almost everything needed to build one.

They are made for 3D printing, so some very little alterations are expected but it should be a very good representation of the slime blower.
